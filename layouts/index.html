                    <h2>Focus on usefulness.</h2>
                    <p class="fragment">It's better to show than tell. Demonstrate the value you provide through expertise. Your readers should feel <em>smarter</em> after they read an article you write. You can write a beautiful, belletristic article on the benefits of a specific product, but users don't want to read a 40-one advertisement, let alone a 1400-word one.</p>

                    <aside class="notes">
                        Think in terms of the Archives web property vs cap.org. Who is our target audience? We often hear the mantra that writing for the web should focus on high readability scores and concision, but there are times where an abundance of plain language fails in transmitting expertise and requires circumlocution in order to communicate what would be otherwise terse writing between specific groups of professionals.

                    <h2>Other Easy Wins: Avoidable Words (cont'd)</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em><strong>Very.</strong></em> (and siblings "really," "extremely," and "quite"). Intensifiers add unnecessary sentence length when aiming for concision.</li>
                        <li><em><strong>Inauthentic introductory clauses ("In today's society," "In today's world," "We understand that...")</strong></em>. Relating a story from your perspective in these cases does not mean you understand the customer's perspective. Focus on facts and examples.</li>
                        <li><em><strong>End user.</strong></em> Unless writing to a target audience of UX specialists, this term can take on negative connotations.</li>
