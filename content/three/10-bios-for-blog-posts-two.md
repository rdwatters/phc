* Keep it short; we don't want a bio that's as long as the article. Aim for < 75 words and one paragraph.
* Try to use information most relevant to the article
* **Example:** Ryan Watters, ELS is a writer, editor, front-end developer, and content strategist living in Chicago, IL. He is currently employed by the College of American Pathologists but devotes equal amounts of time and energy to the open-source web community.
