* In the *active* voice, the sentence subject performs the action directly.
    * Eg, "The boy kicked the ball."
    * The intended message is now *direct*, thereby making it easier to intuit and more engaging when read
* Which sentence sounds more conversational? "John, I drank your last beer." vs "John, your last beer was drunk by me."
* The content we are writing for NIPC should at least start as a conversation or story. Rhetorically, we need *invented* rather than *established* ethos (ie, credibility).
