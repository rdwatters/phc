In order to effectively build credibility with our target audiences (ie, resident pathologists and pathologists at large), we need to write in the context of *shared* experience:

* Write in the first person ("I")
* Pull from *specific* personal experiences whenever possible
* Talk about what you learned from your experience rather than seeming overly sanctimonious in doling out advice
