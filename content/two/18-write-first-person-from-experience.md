To build credibility with our target audiences, try to write in the context of *shared* experience:

* Write in the first person ("I") or directly to the audience (ie, second person)
* Pull from *specific* personal experiences whenever possible; if not personal experiences, defer to a narrative rather than distanced style.
* Write about how you figured out what *you* should do from your experience rather than doling out unsubstantiated advice directly to your reader.
