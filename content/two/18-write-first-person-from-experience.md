To build credibility with our target audiences, try to write in the context of *shared* experience:

* Write in the first person ("I") or directly to the audience (ie, second person "You")
* Pull from *specific* personal experiences whenever possible; if not personal experiences, defer to a narrative rather than distanced, passive, or scientific style
* Focus on how ***you*** learned from ***your*** experience rather than espouse high-level advice without substantiation
