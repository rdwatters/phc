* You are all pathologists
* Your audience is pathologists
* Write about your experiences as a pathologist for a pathologist
    * Pretend you're writing to a less senior colleague who is sitting right across from you
    * Our niche is very well-defined, both in terms of content and organizationally.
* Niche content has considerable SEO value in that it automatically *differentiates* our content
* Ask yourself: is this something my reader can get anywhere? Is this something I would say directly to a pathologist but not XXXX?
