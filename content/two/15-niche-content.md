**This is easier than you think...**

1. You are all pathologists
2. Your target audience are all pathologists
3. Write about your experiences as a pathologist for a pathologist
    * Pretend you're writing to a junior colleague sitting right across from you
    * We have a well-defined niche. We're lucky!
4. Niche = *differentiation* = better SEO value
5. Ask "Is this the kind of content my reader can *only* get from the CAP?"
