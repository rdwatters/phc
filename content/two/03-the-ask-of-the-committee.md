Keeping in mind the new editorial direction, I'm asking for following from the committe:

* Topics and assignments for "blog posts"
* Blog posts will provide more flexibility for marketing because we can direct target audiences to shareable *content* that *demonstrates* rather than *declares* our value and expertise
  * For example, a blog post written about the benefits of attending an RFEC event has more potential for user engagement than a paragraph-long testimonial on a cap.org.page.
