* In the *passive* voice, the action is performed upon the sentence subject, making the action indirect:
    * Eg, "The ball was kicked by the boy."
    * You could change this sentence further to make the *agent* of the action unknown: "The ball was kicked."
* The utility of the passive voice is in it's indirectness...hence popularity in STM pubs
