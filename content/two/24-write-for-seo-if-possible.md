SEO conversations can be a black hole. For the purpose of NIPC content, we can focus on some easy wins.

1. Avoid sales messaging or click-bait-style language
2. Use a consistent heading structure, but only if required to section the content in a way that makes it easy to traverse for our readership
3. Build up "link juice." Link to other internal resources that support your claim, but do *not* be afraid of including links to *credible* resources from *within body copy*.
4. Avoid unnecessary metaphor in things like titles or headings
