1. Avoid sales messaging or click-bait-style language
2. Use a consistent heading structure, but only if required to section the content in a way that makes it easy to traverse for our readership
3. Build up "link juice." Link to *credible* resources from *within body copy* and make sure the text is closely related to the nature of the article being linked to.
4. Avoid unnecessary metaphor in things like titles or headings.
5. Avoid sub-branding content or groups of content. You're trying to differentiate from the *external*, not the internal.
