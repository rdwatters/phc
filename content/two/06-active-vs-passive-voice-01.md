* STM (scientific, technical, medical) publishing is usually written in the *passive* voice.
* Fiction, creative nonfiction, and essays are often written in the *active* voice.
* As such, the de facto CAP approach is to create content in a passive style. This works well for *Archives*,but creates less engaging content for the web.
