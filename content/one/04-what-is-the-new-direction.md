In early 2016, a new editorial direction was developed for the Membership section of cap.org. This new direction was introduced to NIPC in May:

* Shift from bullet points to "long-form content"; specifically, member-generated articles written in the first person
* Focus on keeping users on cap.org rather than sending them to external sites
* Develop content that relates specifically to pathology, the author's unique vantage point and experience, and demonstrates the benefits of CAP membership
