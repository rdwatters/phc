The new editorial direction for the Membership section of cap.org was introduced to PMC, NIPC, and RFEC in 2016:

* **Major Shift:** Moving from bullet points and external resources to...
    * "long-form" content; specifically, member-generated articles ("blog posts") written in the first person
    * Focus on keeping users on cap.org rather than sending them to external sites
    * Develop content that relates specifically to pathology, the author's unique vantage point and experience, and demonstrates the benefits of CAP membership
    * Improve discoverability and credibility (eg, through SEO best practices)
