* "Long-form" does not mean "laborious"
* > 1000 words, but length should be determined by content
* If you don't like the term *long form*, use *blog post* or *article*
* Long-form content is *shareable* on social media
  * How often do friends share articles on Twitter/Facebook?
  * How often do they share advertisements, banners, or commercials?
