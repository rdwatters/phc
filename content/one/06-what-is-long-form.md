* > 1000 words; NB, length is determined by content
* "Long form" is already the most common content format on web: 
    * *Blog posts* 
    * *Newspaper or journal articles*
* But *why*? Long-form content is *shareable* on social media. 
* Consider...
    * How often do colleagues share articles online (e.g. LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, CAPConnect)?
    * How often do colleagues share advertisements, banners, fliers, or commercials?
* What about curation, lists, or abstracts?
    * Users are more likely to seek out digital versions of these abstracts through a) PubMed and b) Google Scholar
    * E.g., PMRG could be transfered to the site as articles discussing the logic behind inclusion of abstracts rather than a list of abstracts themselves.
