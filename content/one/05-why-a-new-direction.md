* Search engine optimization (SEO). Content&mdash;specifically specialized, relevant, article-type content&mdash;should be the most important aspect of your SEO strategy according to Google SEO guidelines
* Users seek out information, not advertisements. Making content discoverable makes the CAP and CAP/RFEC events more discoverable.
* Website = greatest marketing reach
