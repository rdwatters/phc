## Outline

1. Review of Editorial Direction
2. Article Topics
3. Process (Contingent on #2)

### 1. New Editorial Direction


3. First, a Refresher of 2016

In January 2016, RFEC worked on a core modeling exercise to decide the most valuable content for the Residents section of cap.org.

* Calls to action (eg, "Join the CAP")
* Content curation (eg, pointing to existing print content or links to external resources)
* **RFEC-member-specific content (eg, testimonials and RFEC member stories)**

4. What is the new direction?
  * Shift from bullet points to "long-form content"; specifically, member-generated articles written in the first person
  * Keep users on cap.org rather than send them to external sites
  * Develop content that relates specifically to pathology, the author's unique vantage point, and the benefits of CAP membership
5. Why a new direction?
  * SEO - content is the most important aspect of your website according to Google SEO standards
  * In order to make CAP events and membership more discoverable, we need to make content on our site discoverable
  * A website still has the farther marketing reach of any media
  * Not only are search engines smart enough to distinguish between valuable, unique, specialized content from "click bait," but end users are savvy as well. Single-sentence sales messaging, flashy text and images, are immediately identifiable as advertisements or click bait
6. What is "long-form"
  * "Long-form" does not mean "laborious"
  * > 1000 words; think of this like a *blog post*
  * SEO benefits
  * Long-form content is *shareable* on social media
    * How often do your friends share advertisements, banners, or commercials on their Twitter or Facebook accounts?
7. SERPs Screenshot
8. Example of Long Form Content?
  * Richey Screenshot
  * Don't be intimidate by the term "long form"; think of it as just a "blog post"
9. Are other committees implementing this approach?
  * NIPC has created and published 3 articles with 3 articles in the hopper
  * PMC has created and published 1 article with 2 in the hopper
10. Has it worked? Case Study (sorta): NIPC
  * Developed a series of career "resources" called "Life Preserver"
  * Pages were mostly bullet points and links to external sites
  * Changed "Life Preserver" to "Career Resources for New in Practice Pathologists"
  * Published 3 articles and promoted them in multiple areas of the site
11. Results of the Change
  * Improved time on page
  * Reduced bounce rate
  * But what about search engine results pages (SERPs)?
13. "life preserver cap"
  * Google results
15. life preserver funny gif
17. SERP for "Career Resources for Pathologists"

### 2. Article Topics

3. The Ask
  * Keeping in mind the new editorial direction for content, I'd like to decide topics and assignments for blog posts in today's meeting
  * Blog posts will provide more flexibility for marketing because we can direct target audiences to *content*
    * For example, a blog post written about the benefits of attending an RFEC event has more potential for user engagement than a paragraph-long testimonial on a cap.org.page.
5. Suggested Topic Outline: *Insider's Guide*
  * Guide developed originally in 2004
  * Revised by Dr. Rinehart and others in 2014
